# Derrida's Margins (web archive)

This is a web archive of [Derrida's Margins](https://cdh.princeton.edu/projects/derridas-margins/),
a research project sponsored by the Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton.

> Chenoweth, Katie, Alexander Baron-Raiffe, and Rebecca Sutton Koeser (eds.). Derridaâ€™s Margins, version 1.3.3. Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton, 2018. http://derridas-margins.princeton.edu.

The web archive files were created in 2021 with [Browsertrix Crawler](https://github.com/webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler); custom behaviors were used to capture specific interactive
portions of the site.

## Deploying

This web archive is best viewed via nginx proxy with customization using
the [derrida_archive playbook](https://github.com/Princeton-CDH/cdh-ansible/blob/main/playbooks/derrida_archive.yml) in [CDH ansible](https://github.com/Princeton-CDH/cdh-ansible/).

Customizations include disabling or suppressing non-interactive portions of the site, including
search, filtering, and deep-zoom images.
